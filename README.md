# mtcars visualizer app

## Introduction

This is a simple shiny application that enables user to specify ggplot2 aesthetics to display mtcars data scatterplot. 

## How to use

1. Open application following [this link](https://elborh.shinyapps.io/mtcars-visualizer/)
2. Specify input parameters at the pannel to the left
3. See autogenerated plot to the right

## What you can input

The app enables user to select the following aesthetics:

1. X axis
2. Y axis
3. Color
4. Shape
5. Size

For each input you can choose any mtcars variable of appropriate type.

## Enable trend line

If you want trend line to be shown, enable the "Show Trend Line" check box. The trend line will be calculated on server side and will be added to the plot.

You can also use the "Trend line by" selector to specify if you want a trend line be calculated based on all observations (select "All" in this case), or show individual trend line for each group of observations (select specific grouping criterion in this case).
